Release IAM role credentials
.SH DESCRIPTION
The euare\-releaserole utility removes the credentials created by euareassumerole(1) by outputting shellcode that deletes the environment
variables it creates.  Use it inside an eval command to make this
process seamless:
.SH DESCRIPTION
$ eval `euare\-releaserole`
.SH DESCRIPTION
Note that if the credentials used to initially assume the role were
supplied in the form of environment variables those environment
variables will need to be reset:
